# snake

A remake of the classic game built in Python. At this point in time, Python 2.7 has reached EoL, and is no longer supported. The demo should still be in a playable state, but there is no guarantee that will always be the case. You can find the demo on [Replit](https://replit.com/@grahamhub/snake).
